              In life, I am driven by two passions: unraveling complex problems
              through code and imparting the skills to others on how to navigate
              such challenges. We all carry the imprint of great teachers from
              our schooling years â€“ individuals who had the alchemy to transmute
              our raw energies into passion and arouse interest in subjects we
              initially found inscrutable or unappealing.
