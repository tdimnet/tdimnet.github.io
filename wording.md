During the last years, I've worked with different companies from various size and objectives, such as Datadog, OpenClassrooms, and SensCritique. My main programming languages have always been JavaScript/TypeScript and Python (and also Php).

As, Kirk Kaiser, my mentor and former manager at Datadog says, I trully think we all have a super power. People need to find the right organisation and the right people to use it without the fear of judgment..

    During the last 10 years, I have worked with different companies from
    various sizes. You may know some of them: Datadog, OpenClassrooms,
    SensCritique, WeDigitalGarden (Now WeManinty). My main focus was
    always been engineering. I love building products that make People
    life better. I just want to make the work a better place.

    I started programming with Php more than 10 years ago. Since then, I
    have mostly written JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. I tend to be a
    pragrammatic programmer by using the right tool at the right time.
    Over engineering is neither an option, or something I like to do. Keep
    it simple stupid, as they say.

    Teaching to people is something that makes me feel alive. I teach them
    about programming, cloud engineering, and data science but also about
    human behaviours, psychology, and product management. There is a
    reason why I decided to create a company dedicated to teaching.

    Over the years, my lessons, especialy the ones I wrote for
    OpenClassrooms, have attracted thousand of students. When I was still
    on LinkedIn, there was not a week where I did not a message from a
    student. This is something that makes me proud but it algo gives
    responsabilities. Education purpose is to make students self thinker
    and proud.

    Do you know remember your best teachers at school? I do. I remember
    having one of the best maths teacher. He didn't make me feel stupid
    when I did not something, I did not judge me. This is the teacher I am
    trying to do. It doesn't always work but when it does, it does it for
    real.
