During the last years, I've worked with different companies from various size and objectives, such as Datadog, OpenClassrooms, and SensCritique. My main programming languages have always been JavaScript/TypeScript and Python (and also Php). 

As, Kirk Kaiser, my mentor and former manager at Datadog says, I trully think we all have a super power. People need to find the right organisation and the right people to use it without the fear of judgment..
